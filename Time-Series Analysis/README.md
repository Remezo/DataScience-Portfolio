# [REINVENT THE WHEEL HACKATHON](https://www.reinvent-the-wheel.com/)

### Problem Statement

* __Scrap Tire Forecast__: Predict How many tires of a given size_code will be collected by a given Distribution Center every day.

* __Logistics Optimization__: How to efficiently move the scrap tires downstream to the recycler?

## Description

This is an experinece that I am not ready to forget anytime soon.

Excitement filled the air as I signed up for a hackathon with over 120 datascientists from Google, Micheli, Snowflake, and many more. I arrived at the ATD/Torqata venue eager to showcase my skills and collaborate with others. Since I had no team, I got randomly paired with people who also didn't have one, and we became the underdogs of the hackathon. However, we worked together like we had been a team for years. We brainstormed, gave feedback to each other, and put in our best efforts as we coded, tested, and tweaked our solution. The 36 hours flew by, and we were amazed by how much we had accomplished and our 96% accurate model. 

At the end of the hackathon, we were overjoyed to receive the best use of cloud prize , judged by Google employees themselves. However, the true reward was not the prize but the bond and connection we formed as a team. We had come together as strangers and left as friends who shared a common goal and worked tirelessly to achieve it. The experience was a testament to the power of teamwork and how it can bring people from different backgrounds and skillsets together to achieve greatness. The hackathon had not only challenged us intellectually but also allowed us to form a lasting bond that went beyond the prize.

 ## Disclaimer

I ensured the confidentiality of the TORQATA/ATD proprietary data and focused solely on the first part of the challenge, choosing not to include the logistics optimization that we solved using the PULP python library for linear programming.
